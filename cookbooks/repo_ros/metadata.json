  "long_description": "# RightScale \"repo_ros\" Cookbook\n\n## DESCRIPTION:\n\nProvides the Remote Object Store implementation of the 'repo' resource to\nmanage source code download from Remote Object Store repositories.\n\n## REQUIREMENTS:\n\n* Requires the ['repo' Lightweight Resource cookbook][repo]. See \"repo\" cookbook\n  README for details.\n* Requires a virtual machine launched from a RightScale-managed RightImage.\n\n[repo]: https://github.com/rightscale/rightscale_cookbooks/tree/master/cookbooks/repo\n\n## COOKBOOKS DEPENDENCIES:\n\nPlease see `metadata.rb` file for the latest dependencies.\n\n* `repo`\n\n## KNOWN LIMITATIONS:\n\nThis cookbook only supports the retrieval of code from Amazon S3, Rackspace\nCloud Files, and SoftLayer Object Storage.\n\n## SETUP/USAGE:\n\n* Provider will automatically be initialized when you add the `repo:default`\n  recipe to your ServerTemplate's runlist.\n* Once setup, use the recipes in the 'repo' cookbook to install and manage how\n  application code will be retrieved from ROS locations.\n  See the 'repo' cookbook's README.md for usage details.\n* Select 'repo_ros' option in the repo/default/provider input.\n\nTo access to Remote Object Store repositories all inputs shown below must be\nfilled.\n\n* repo/default/storage_account_provider\n* repo/default/repository\n* repo/default/prefix\n* repo/default/account\n* repo/default/credintial\n\nThe `repo/default/endpoint` input allows to override the default endpoint.\n\nMore detailed input descriptions can be found in the 'repo' cookbook's\nREADME.md.\n\n## DETAILS:\n\n### General\n\nThe 'repo_ros' implementation can be called with help from the Lightweight\nResource, which can be found in the `repo` cookbook.\n\nFor more information about Lightweight Resources and Providers (LWRPs), please\nsee [Lightweight Resources and Providers][Guide].\n\n[Guide]: http://support.rightscale.com/12-Guides/Chef_Cookbooks_Developer_Guide/04-Developer/06-Development_Resources/Lightweight_Resources_and_Providers_(LWRP)\n\n### LWRPs:\n\nThe `repo_ros` provider is defined in providers/default.rb file and contains\nsource code for `:pull` and `:capistrano_pull` actions.\nFor more information about these actions please see the `repo` cookbook's\nREADME.\n\nThe `repo_ros` provider allows the retrieval of source code from Amazon S3,\nRackspace Cloud Files, Swift and SoftLayer Object Storage ROS remote\nrepositories.\n\nFor normal operations it requires the \"repo\" resource, which acts as the\ninterface to all `repo_ros` provider logic.\n\n##### Actions:\n\n`:pull`\n\nStandard repository pull. Your source code repository will be pulled from the\nspecified ROS remote repository to a specified destination on the local\ninstance.\n\n`:capistrano_pull`\n\nPerforms a standard repository pull plus a capistrano deployment style is\napplied.\n\n* Standard Opscode chef capistrano implementation does not support ROS\n* Downloaded ROS repository will be converted to a git repository\n* Then the capistrano deployment will be applied using the `capistranize`\n  definition\n* Git attributes will be removed after everything is applied.\n\n##### Usage Example:\n\nFor usage examples, please see the corresponding section in `repo` cookbook's\nREADME.\n\n## LICENSE:\n\nCopyright RightScale, Inc.
