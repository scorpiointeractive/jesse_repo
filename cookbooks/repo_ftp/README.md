## DETAILS:

### General

The 'repo_ftp' implementation can be called with the help of the Lightweight
Resource, which can be found in the `repo` cookbook.

For more information about Lightweight Resources and Providers (LWRPs), please
see [Lightweight Resources and Providers][Guide].

[Guide]: http://support.rightscale.com/12-Guides/Chef_Cookbooks_Developer_Guide/04-Developer/06-Development_Resources/Lightweight_Resources_and_Providers_(LWRP)

### LWRPs:

The `repo_ftp` provider is defined in the `providers/default.rb` file, which
contains source code for `:pull` and `:capistrano_pull` actions.
For more info about these actions please see the `repo` cookbook's README.

The `repo_ftp` provider allows the retrieval of source code from FTP servers.

For normal operations, it requires the 'repo' resource, which acts as the
interface to all `repo_ftp` provider logic.

##### Actions:

`:pull`
Standard repository pull. Pull source code from a remote repository by
specifying its location with a URL.

`:capistrano_pull`
Perform standard pull and then a capistrano deployment style will be applied.

##### Usage Example:

For usage examples, please see the corresponding section in `repo` cookbook's
README.
