# RightScale System DNS cookbook

## DESCRIPTION:

This cookbook provides a set of dynamic DNS recipes used by RightScale
ServerTemplates including the Database Manager ServerTemplates.

## REQUIREMENTS:

* An account with the desired DNS service provider.
* DNS A recordâ€™s created external to this cookbook.

## COOKBOOKS DEPENDENCIES:

Please see `metadata.rb` file for the latest dependencies.

## KNOWN LIMITATIONS:

Currently only the first private IP address can be set.

## SETUP/USAGE:

* Place `sys_dns::default` recipe into your runlist to set up the dynamic DNS
  provider resource. This will install the support tools and chef providers for
  the dynamic DNS provider selected by the "DNS Service Provider" input. When
  using a RightScale ServerTemplate, this will automatically add the common DNS
  service provider attributes to your ServerTemplate inputs.
* Place `sys_dns::do_set_private` recipe in your runlist to set the DNS record
  identified by the "DNS Record ID" input to the first private IP address of
  the instance if the private IP is desired.
* Place `sys_dns::do_set_public` recipe in your runlist to set the DNS record
  identified by the "DNS Record ID" input to the first public IP address of the
  instance if the public IP is desired. This recipe will fail if no valid
  public IP is found for the instance.

## DETAILS:

### General

Cookbook currently supports Cloud DNS, DNSMadeEasy, DynDNS, and Amazon Route53
DNS service providers.
A new chef provider can be created to add support for additional dynamic DNS
service providers.
