# RightScale PostgreSQL Database Cookbook

## DESCRIPTION:

Provides the PostgreSQL implementation of the 'db' resource to install and
manage PostgreSQL database stand-alone servers and clients.

## DETAILS

The 'db' implementation is defined by a Lightweight Provider, which can be
found in the providers/default.rb file.

## REQUIREMENTS:

* Requires a VM launched from a RightScale managed RightImage
* Needs RightScale ServerTemplate tools gem installed on system.

## COOKBOOKS DEPENDENCIES:

Please see `metadata.rb` file for the latest dependencies.

## KNOWN LIMITATIONS:

There are no known limitations.

## SETUP:

* To setup only the database client, place `db::default` recipe into
  your runlist. This will pull in generic client inputs, provide
  provider selection input and install client. Set db/provider_type input in
  RightScale ServerTemplate to set provider and version for 'db' resource.
* To setup a PostgreSQL database client and server, place the following recipes
  in order to your runlist:

    db_postgres::setup_server_<version>
      loads the PostgreSQL provider, tuning parameters, as well as other
      PostgreSQL-specific attributes into the node as inputs.
    db::install_server
      sets up generic server and client inputs. This will also include
      db::default recipe which installs the client.

  For example: To set up and install PostgreSQL 9.1 client and server

    db_postgres::setup_server_9_1
    db::install_server

## USAGE:

### Basic usage

Once setup, use the recipes in the 'db' cookbook to install and manage your
PostgreSQL database servers and clients. See the `db/README.md` for usage
details.

### PostgreSQL Tuning and postgresql.conf and pg_hba.conf

Custom tuning parameters can be applied by overriding the
`postgresql.conf.erb` template or by setting the values in the attributes
file. For more information and an example override repository, please see:
[Override Chef Cookbooks][CCDG].

The tuning parameters are adjusted based on the database server usage. Shared
servers are allocated %50 of the resources of a dedicated server.

The current implementation sets the following tuning parameters:

* max_connections: Static setting with 400 for a dedicated server
  and 200 for a shared server
* shared_buffers: Dynamically set to %25 of available memory.

### PostgreSQL Replication

PostgreSQL streaming replication is asynchronous by default. If the primary
server crashes then some transactions that were committed may not have been
replicated to the standby server, causing data loss. The amount of data loss is
proportional to the replication delay at the time of failover. Synchronous
replication offers the ability to confirm that all changes made by a transaction
have been transferred to one synchronous standby server. This extends the
standard level of durability offered by a transaction commit. This level of
protection is referred to as 2-safe replication in computer science theory. For
