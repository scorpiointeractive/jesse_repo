See \"repo\" cookbook\n  README for details.\n* Requires a virtual machine launched from a RightScale-managed RightImage.\n\n[repo]: https://github.com/rightscale/rightscale_cookbooks/tree/master/cookbooks/repo\n\n## COOKBOOKS DEPENDENCIES:\n\nPlease see `metadata.rb` file for the latest dependencies.\n\n* `rightscale`\n* `repo`\n\n## KNOWN LIMITATIONS:\n\nThere are no known limitations.\n\n## SETUP/USAGE:\n\n* Provider will be automatically initialized when you add \"repo:default\" recipe\n  to your ServerTemplate runlist\n* Once set up, use the recipes in the 'repo' cookbook to manage downloading from\n  your code repository. See the repo/README.md for usage details.\n* Select the 'repo_rsync' option for the repo/default/provider input.\n* To perform correct operations, values for the repo/url and others must be\n  provided.\n* The repo/ssh_key input must contain a string with a valid SSH key or\n  'key'-type variable from the RightScale dashboard.\n\n## DETAILS:\n\n### General\n\nThe 'repo_rsync' implementation can be called with the help of the Lightweight\nResource, which can be found in the `repo` cookbook.\n\nFor more information about Lightweight Resources and Providers (LWRPs), please\nsee [Lightweight Resources and Providers][Guide].\n\n[Guide]: http://support.rightscale.com/12-Guides/Chef_Cookbooks_Developer_Guide/04-Developer/06-Development_Resources/Lightweight_Resources_and_Providers_(LWRP)\n\n### LWRPs:\n\nThe `repo_rsync` provider is defined in the `providers/default.rb` file, which\ncontains source code for `:pull` and `:capistrano_pull` actions.\nFor more info about these actions please see the `repo` cookbook's README.\n\nThe `repo_rsync` provider allows the retrieval of source code via rsync.\n\nFor normal operations, it requires the 'repo' resource, which acts as the\ninterface to all `repo_rsync` provider logic.\n\n##### Actions:\n\n`:pull`\n\nStandard repository pull. Pull source code from a remote repository by\nspecifying its location with a URL.\n\n`:capistrano_pull`\n\nPerform standard pull and then a capistrano deployment style will be applied.\n\n##### Usage Example:\n\nFor usage examples, please see the corresponding section in `repo` cookbook's\nREADME.\n\n## LICENSE:\n\nCopyright RightScale, Inc.
