## SETUP/USAGE:

to install the database client.

ServerTemplate built on this cookbook can be combined in two modes:

1 - For apps with bundler support, keep the "requirements.txt" file under
application ROOT directory, and "run_custom_python_commands" for migration
commands

2 - For apps without bundler support, provide package(s) name as user input
while server launch, and "run_custom_python_commands" for migration commands

Note: In operational mode to install additional python packages for Django app
server, provide package(s) name as user input and re-run the `app::default` boot
recipe.

Mix these recipes in any way to satisfy project requirements.

### Attributes:

These are settings used in recipes and templates. Default values are noted.

Note: Only "internal" cookbook attributes are described here. Descriptions of
attributes which have inputs you can find in metadata.rb cookbook file.

###### General attributes

* `node[:app_django][:module_dependencies]` - Modules required for Apache.
* `node[:app_django][:app][:debug_mode]` - Django application debug mode.
* `node[:app_django][:apache][:serve_local_files]` - Used to enable/disable the
  serve of any existing local files.
* `node[:app_django][:deploy_dir]` - Path in the specified repository where
  application code will be pulled from.
* `node[:app_django][:pip_bin]` - Path to Python pip bin directory.
* `node[:app_django][:python_bin]` - Path to Python bin directory.
* `node[:app_django][:project][:opt_pip_list]` - A list of additional python
  packages, required for django application
* `node[:app_django][:project][:custom_cmd]` - A list of python commands
  required for django application initialization.

### Templates:

* `apache_mod_wsgi_vhost.erb` - Configuration for apache vhost file used in the
  `app::setup_vhost` recipe and defined in `:setup_vhost` action of the
  `app_django` LWRP.
* `wsgi.py.erb` - Configuration for Apache-Django WSGI config file used in the
  `app::setup_vhost` recipe and defined in `:setup_vhost` action of the
  `app_django` LWRP.
* `settings.py.erb` - Rename django "settings.py" file under app root to
  "settings_default.py", configure new "settings.py" file for project database
  connection used in the `app::setup_db_connection` recipe and defined in
  `:setup_db_connection` action of the `app_django` LWRP.

### LWRPs:

`app_django` Lightweight provider is defined in the providers/default.rb file,
it contains source for the following actions:

* `:install`
* `:setup_vhost`
* `:start`
* `:stop`
* `:restart`
* `:reload`
* `:code_update`
* `:setup_db_connection`

For more info about these actions, please see the `app` cookbook README.

For normal operations it requires "app" resource which will act as the interface
to all `app_django` provider logic.

##### Actions

* `:install` - Install packages required for application server setup.
* `:setup_vhost` - Set up apache vhost file with wsgi module directives
  included.
* `:start` - Start sequence for Django application server.
* `:stop` - Stop sequence for Django application server.
* `:reload` - Reload sequence for Django application server.
* `:restart` - Restart sequence for Django application server.
* `:code_update` - Perform project source code update/download using user
  selected "repo" LWRP. Set up logrotate configuration.
* `:setup_db_connection` - Perform project settings.py database connection
  configuration. The driver type is specified as 'python' and the db_<provider>
  cookbook's `install_client_driver` action performs necessary steps to install
  the database adapter.
