# To enable continuous backups, we create JSON file for each block device under
# /var/lib/rightscale_block_device_#{device}.json. JSON file will have all the
# resource attributes set up for the device. We initiate a cron job to schedule
# primary backups. Time parameters for cron job are obtained from
# "cron_backup_minute" and "cron_backup_hour" attributes defined in
# cookbooks/block_device/resources/default.rb.
# See cookbooks/block_device/libraries/default.rb for definitions of
# "do_for_block_devices" and "get_device_or_default" methods.
